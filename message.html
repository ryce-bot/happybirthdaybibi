    <p>To the love of my life,

      Happy birthday, baby! It’s your first birthday that we get to celebrate as a couple, and I’m so thankful for that. You, my love, are the most caring and loving person I’ve ever met. Every day when I wake up, I always look forward to talking to you, bebiiii! Mahal, you’re the most important person in my life. I thank God for giving me the kindest, sweetest, most patient, most handsome, and funniest partner I could ever ask for, and I’m so happy I get to celebrate your day with you.</p>
      
      <p>You, my love, have made such a big impact in my life. Every day I smile when I think about the little habits you have, like how you scrunch your lips when you’re really focused. Honestly, bebi, a part of you always finds a way to inspire me, from how hard you work to how patient and understanding you are. Being with you has taught me how to open up and really step out of my comfort zone, and I have to thank you for that.</p>
      
      <p>Happy birthday to my favourite human, my best friend, my first choice, and my husband. You’ll always be my forever crush, and I thank God every day for giving you to me. You’re the core of my heart and the warmth in this cold life. I love you sooo muchhh with my universal setttt!!!! Mwaaaaa</p>
